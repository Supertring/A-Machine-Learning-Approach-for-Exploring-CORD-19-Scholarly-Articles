# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Exploring-CORD-19-Scholarly-Articles

The WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic that
is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus and has created challenges
among scientist and engineers. Extensive research are going on
to find possible vaccines and solutions to control the pandemic.
Collaborations between scientists, research institutions are very
vital for the success. They require fast and efficient access of
information from huge amount of research articles published
about covid, virus, pandemic and related topics.
In response to the pandemic, the contribution of this research
will be to apply ML and NLP techniques to explore insights
from the resource of approximately 10000 scholarly articles about
CORD-19.
